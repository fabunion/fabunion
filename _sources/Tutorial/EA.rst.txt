Use external axis
============================================
Sometimes we need print a large scale object,we need the help of external axis

Create start pose
--------------------------------------------
In rhino,create A and B points.

.. code:: console

    A:[0,0,0]
    B:[0, 3000, 0]

Use Line component to generate a line

Add components
--------------------------------------------
Add Metalweldtool toolhead,KR20r1810 robot,TJLabAxis external axisï¼Œand connect them as figure:

Now you drag simulate slider,you can find the robot cannot move along the external axis,so it cannot run the whole path,because we have not set the external axis value

Add external axis value
--------------------------------------------
Connect components as figure below:

.. image:: img/a9.png

The reason for these components is to generate the same count of external axis value as the count of path points,now external axis value is 0~2700(with this value,robot can run well).

Now,drag the simulation slider,you can see the robot print well.
