Customize KUKA&ABB Robot
============================================

.. note::
    Document of this tutorial is CustomizeRobot.3dm , CustomizeRobot.gh | Downlaod in Github_

FUROBOT supports several type of robot,but still a lot of robot cannot be included.
So we provide customize robot component for KUKA and ABB(UR is all included).
The method to customize the robot is same in ABB and KUKA,so we provide a example on ABB:

Load Robot model
--------------------------------------------

In Rhino,load the finished robot mesh model(in CustomizeRobot.3dm)
This model is from ABB official download center

Select the base mesh,and put it into a mesh component(you can hide other robot mesh meanwhile):

Create a "Robotmesh" for this base,because its colour is black,so we input a "Colour" swatch component.

.. note::
    RobotMesh is a minimum element for customizing robot,it has colour and mesh.

This base element belongs to base part.

.. note::
    Robot part is the minimum element for robot kinetics.

Base part can contain many robot elements in one time,but in base part,it only contains one element.
So we can just connect previous robot mesh to this robot part:

Then connect the robot part to ABB customize robot component:

Customize tool
--------------------------------------------
Then a custom tool is finished,you can replace the tool of Getting Started with this custom tool:

Keep the XYZABC parameter,the newly done tool can also be used for ABB and UR robots.

.. note::
    If the tool parameter is from UR robot,then you should use URToolDataToXYZABC for convertion（ABB is similar）:
